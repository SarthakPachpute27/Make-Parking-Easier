# Make-Parking-Easier
Make Parking Easier is a Salesforce-based project designed to simplify the process of parking slot booking and tracking

# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis  

## Requirement Gathering  
- Parking slots are difficult to track manually in malls, campuses, and offices.  
- Users need a way to **check available slots, book instantly, and get confirmation**.  
- Admins/attendants need to **monitor occupancy** and manage slots efficiently.  

## Stakeholder Analysis  
- **Customer/User** → Books slots using portal.  
- **Parking Attendant/Admin** → Manages slots, monitors usage.  
- **System** → Auto-assigns nearest available slot, updates status, sends confirmations.  

## Business Process Mapping  
1. User logs in → checks availability.  
2. User books a slot → system auto-updates slot status.  
3. System sends booking confirmation email/SMS.  
4. Attendant can view/manage daily bookings.  
5. Reports show parking usage & peak hours.  

## Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis  
- Urban areas face parking congestion, wasting time and fuel.  
- Existing smart parking apps are IoT-heavy and costly.  
- A **Salesforce CRM-based solution** is lightweight, scalable, and easy for organizations to adopt.  

## AppExchange Exploration  
- Similar solutions exist for **asset tracking** and **facility booking**.  
- Salesforce AppExchange apps (e.g., resource booking) inspired this parking slot booking model.
